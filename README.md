# Trade Directories Data Extraction


## Short summary

A multi-stage investigation into methods for extracting data from Trade Directories at scale, with a latter focus on the preparation of nineteenth century Bradford (and Newcastle) directories for geospatial analysis in relation to novel methods of Occupation classification



## Research questions

- What digital methods are most suitable for use at different stages of an extractive pipeline for the particular challenges posed by Trade Directories and their heterogeneity, what are the obstacles to scalability using Machine Learning methods and how might these be addressed?



- What new opportunities for historical analysis does the transformation of Trade Directories into machine-readable data open?
